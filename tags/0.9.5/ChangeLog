 - swiginac: added automatic evaluation of matrices (patch from Matrin Sandve Alnæs)
 - swiginac: added exception handing (patch from Martin Sandve Alnæs)
 - swiginac: check_deg_poly.py, check the methods ldegree, degree, coeff,
   expand and collect of polynomials
 - swiginac: functions.i, fix G with two parameters
 - swiginac: exam_diff.py, pythonize missing regression tests
 - swiginac: exam_color.py, new regression tests ported from GiNaC
 - swiginac: wrap classes color, su3one, su3t, su3f, su3d and the related utility functions
 - swiginac: exam_clifford.py, new regression tests ported from GiNaC
 - swiginac: constant.i, symbol.i, tensor.i, wildcard.i, wrap the default
   constructor (no arguments) when it appears to make sense; in GiNaC these

 - swiginac: exam_powerlaws.py, new regression tests from GiNaC/PyGiNaC
 - swiginac: function.i, applied patched  from Matti Peltom?ki. This fixes
   functions with multiple arguments.
 - swiginac: GiNaC::ex now exposed to Python through the converters:
   ex *toex(basic & b);
   ex *toex(lst & l);
   ex * basic:: toex();
 - Released 0.9.4 [2005-11-28]
 - swiginac: replaced floats with doubles in the special methods defined in
   basic.i. Thanks to Matti Peltom?ki for the patch
 - Symbolic: Matrix.__getitem__ more robust and accepts certain slices (work remaining)
 - Symbolic: Added determinant() to Matrix, added corresponding tests
 - Symbolic: Added expand to Expr, changed def diff(self, symbol, count) to 
   def diff(self, symbol, count=1). Tests updated accordingly
 - Symbolic: Added copy and __copy__ to all classes
 - Extended ginac.basic with method for copying; basic::copy()
 - Minor bug fixes in Symbolic, Expr and Vector can now be multiplied (componentwise)
 - Released 0.9.3 [2005-11-13]
 - bug fixes and some more features in Symbolic
 - setup.py more platform independent (may work with cygwin?)
 - Added ChangeLog
