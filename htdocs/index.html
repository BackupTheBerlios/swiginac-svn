<h2>About</h2>
<p>Swiginac is a Python interface to <a href="http://www.ginac.de">GiNaC</a>,
built with <a href="http://www.swig.org">SWIG</a>. The aim of swiginac is to
make all the functionality of GiNaC accessible from Python as an extension
module.</p>

<p>Current status is alpha: a lot (but not all yet) of the GiNaC classes are
exposed, virtually all of the GiNaC tests pass.</p>

href="http://developer.berlios.de/projects/swiginac/">group pages</a> on

<h2>Other python bindings to GiNaC</h2>

According to our knowledge:
<ul>
<li>The first python binding was <a
href="http://cens.ioc.ee/projects/pyginac/">pyginac</a> by Pearu Peterson in
2001, done in boost python, but the project is dead.
<li>It's succesor, also called <a
href="http://pyginac.sourceforge.net">pyginac</a>, was developed by Jonathan
Brandmeyer and later co-authored by Matti Peltomäki. This version is in alpha stage, still active, also done in boost python.
</ul>

<p>
Why another bindings? Because we found out that it was easier to implement
new features using SWIG than using boost python, at least for the authors (one
of the authors tried both SWIG and boost python). It was easier for us to write
all the bindings from scratch in SWIG, than to implement new features in
pyginac, but you can choose which bindings you prefer more.
</p>

<p>
The problem with SWIG was, that it didn't used to handle C++ much, but this
changed rapidly recently (late 2004 and 2005), so now it is a working alternative to boost python and sip. And honestly, we think SWIG is the best. :)
