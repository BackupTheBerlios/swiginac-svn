<h2>About</h2>
<p>Swiginac is a Python interface to <a href="http://www.ginac.de">GiNaC</a>,
built with <a href="http://www.swig.org">SWIG</a>. The aim of swiginac is to
make all the functionality of GiNaC accessible from Python as an extension
module.</p>

<p>Current status is beta; a lot (but not all yet) of the GiNaC classes are
exposed, virtually all of the GiNaC tests pass.</p>

<p>For more information, documentation and software downloads, visit our <a
href="http://developer.berlios.de/projects/swiginac/">group pages</a> on
BerliOS.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>
Just a few illustrations from the Python interpreter:
</p>
<div class="shell">>>> x=symbol("x")
>>> sin(x).series(x==0, 8)
1*x+(-1/6)*x**3+1/120*x**5+(-1/5040)*x**7+Order(x**8)
</div>
<p>or</p>
<div class="shell">>>> x = symbol('x')
>>> y = symbol('y')
>>> lsolve([3*x + 5*y == 2, 5*x+y == -3], [x,y])
[x==-17/22, y==19/22]
</div>

<h2>Other Python bindings to GiNaC</h2>

<p>
According to our knowledge:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The first Python binding was <a
href="http://cens.ioc.ee/projects/pyginac/">pyginac</a> by Pearu Peterson in
2001, done in Boost.Python. There has been no activity in this project since 2001, so we consider it dead.
<li>It's successor, also called <a
href="http://pyginac.sourceforge.net">pyginac</a>, was developed by Jonathan
Brandmeyer and later co-authored by Matti Peltom?ki. This version is in alpha stage, still active, also done in Boost.Python.
</ul>

<p>
Why another bindings? Because we found out that it was easier to implement
new features using SWIG than using Boost.Python, at least for the authors (one
of the authors tried both SWIG and Boost.Python). Instead of implementing new
features in pyginac, we found it easier to write the bindings from scratch
using SWIG.</p>

<p>
The problem with SWIG was, that it didn't used to handle C++ much, but this
changed rapidly recently (late 2004 and 2005), so now it is a working
alternative to Boost.Python and sip. And honestly, we think the SWIG
approach of wrapper code generation is great.</p>

<h2>Download</h2>

<p>Visit our <a href="http://developer.berlios.de/projects/swiginac/">group pages</a>
for software downloads. Additionally, the development code is in the svn repository. You can check it out using this command:</p>

<div class="shell">$ svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/swiginac/trunk swiginac
</div>

<P>You can also browse the SVN <a href="http://svn.berlios.de/wsvn/swiginac/trunk/?rev=0&sc=0">online</a>.</P>

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>G&uuml;nter Milde has made a <a href"ginac-tutorial.py.html">swiginac
tutorial</a> which is about all the documentation of swiginac that exists.
Except from this, swiginac is mostly undocumented. To get started, download the
latest release and browse the unit tests in tests/swiginac. Also, <a
href="chicago05.pdf">his presentation</a> of swiginac given at the Fenics'05
meeting in Chicago may be useful.</p>

<h2>Help wanted</h2>
We could really need a few more developers in the project. If you are using
swiginac or GiNaC, know swig, and like hacking, let me know at skavhaug at simula.no.
