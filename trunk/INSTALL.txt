SWIGINAC INSTALLATION NOTES
---------------------------

Dependencies
------------

Before compiling and installing swiginac, make sure that you have installed
GiNaC (ftp://ftpthep.physik.uni-mainz.de/pub/GiNaC/) and SWIG
(http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1645). Versions known to
work are GiNaC version 1.3.x and SWIG version >= 1.3.24.

Most recent Linux distributions have packages for the above software. E.g., in
Debian unstable (sarge), the packages are:
libginac1.3c2
libginac-dev
swig1.3

Installing using distutils
--------------------------

Make sure that the dependencies (see above) are met. Additionally, the Python
module distutils must be installed. You might need to edit the setup.py script
to reflect the location of the ginac include and shared library files (only
tested on Debian unstable). This is done by editing the arguments
"include_dirs" and "library_dirs" in the Extension constructor.

Then, run:
python setup.py build_ext --swig-cpp
python setup.py install

At this point, swiginac should be installed in the site-packages directory of
your default python interpreter (on Debian with Python2.3:
/usr/lib/python2.3/site-packages).

Installing using make
---------------------
Again, make sure that the dependencies (see above) are met. Edit the Makefile
to reflect your system settings. I.e., edit PYTHONVERSION (e.g. 2.3), INCLUDES
(must contain the directories of the python and ginac header files), and PREFIX
(installation directory). Also, put PREFIX in PYTHONPATH. In bash, run: export
PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$PREFIX 
with PREFIX identically to the definition in Makefile.

Run:
make 

This will construct the swiginac extension module. The module consists of the 
files swiginac.py and _swiginac.so. 

If you want to install the module in PREFIX, run:
make install

Verify the installation
-----------------------
Go to your home directory and start python. The issue the commands:
>>> from swiginac import *
>>> x = symbol('x')
>>> y = symbol('y')
>>> print sin(x*y).diff(x,1)
cos(y*x)*y
>>> 

Then, re-visit the directory containing this file, and enter tests directory:
cd tests
python checkall.py

Hopefully, you will get a message telling you that 87 tests have been run, and
that they all went well.

Final note
----------
swiginac is currently without documentation. Therefore, browsing the scripts in
the tests directory is the best way of learning how to use swiginac. Also, read
the documentation the the GiNaC homepages (http://www.ginac.de/tutorial/ and
http://www.ginac.de/reference/).
