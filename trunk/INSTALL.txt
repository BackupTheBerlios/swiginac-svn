SWIGINAC INSTALLATION NOTES
---------------------------

Dependencies
------------

Before compiling and installing swiginac, make sure that you have installed
GiNaC (ftp://ftpthep.physik.uni-mainz.de/pub/GiNaC/) and SWIG
(http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1645). Versions known to
work are GiNaC version >= 1.3.2 and SWIG version >= 1.3.24. 
(Remark: GiNaC version 1.3.0, 1.3.1 are known to _not_ work!)

Most recent Linux distributions have packages for the above software. E.g., in
Debian unstable (sid), the packages are:
libginac1.3c2
libginac-dev
swig1.3

Supported platforms
-------------------
We have successfully installed swiginac using the distutils file on the
following platforms:

 - Debian Linux unstable (sid): i386
 - MacOSX "Tiger" 10.4

Installing using distutils
--------------------------

Make sure that the dependencies (see above) are met. Additionally, the Python
module distutils must be installed.

To install swiginac and Symbolic, simply run:
python setup.py build
python setup.py install

At this point, swiginac and Symbolic should be installed in the site-packages
directory of your default Python interpreter (on Debian with Python2.3:
/usr/lib/python2.3/site-packages).

Installing using make
---------------------
For impatient:

cd src/swiginac
make
make install

More info:
Make sure that the dependencies (see above) are met.  The Makefile works on
Debian unstable, if you use other system, you may need to edit it. I.e., edit
PYTHONVERSION (e.g. 2.3), INCLUDES (must contain the directories of the Python
and ginac header files), eventually PREFIX (installation directory). The
default PREFIX is in site-packages in the Python installation, so it should
work out of the box, but if you prefer other directory, you may need to put
PREFIX in PYTHONPATH. In bash, run: export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$PREFIX with
PREFIX identical to the definition in Makefile.

Run:
cd src/swiginac
make 

This will construct the swiginac extension module. The module consists of the
files swiginac.py and _swiginac.so. If you prefer not to install anything, you
can use swiginac just now - import swiginac.py and you are fine.

If you want to install the module in PREFIX, run:
make install


Verify the installation
-----------------------
Go to your home directory and start Python. Then issue the commands:
>>> from swiginac import *
>>> x = symbol('x')
>>> y = symbol('y')
>>> print sin(x*y).diff(x,1)
cos(y*x)*y
>>> 

Then, re-visit the directory containing this file, and run the unit tests:
cd tests/swiginac
python checkall.py
cd ../Symbolic
python SymbolicTests.py

Hopefully, you will get a message telling you that more than 90 tests have been
run, and that they all went well.

Final note
----------
swiginac is currently without documentation. Therefore, browsing the scripts in
the tests directory is the best way of learning its usage. Also, read
the documentation the the GiNaC homepages (http://www.ginac.de/tutorial/ and
http://www.ginac.de/reference/).
